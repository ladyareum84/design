# GSAP: Full page snap using ScrollTrigger + ScrollTo 

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/urbgimtam/pen/XWXdypQ](https://codepen.io/urbgimtam/pen/XWXdypQ).

This is using ScrollTrigger to detect when the page "panel" is visible, triggers the event 'onEnter' and 'onEnterBack' to navigate through the panels.
However, there is a problem when scrolling backwards, panels slide back to start.

GSAP's new plugin ScrollTrigger is great, though.
